# Advertising Sales Prediction  

## Overview  
This project uses **Linear Regression** to predict product sales based on advertising budgets across **TV, Radio, and Newspaper**. By training the model on historical advertising data, it provides insights into how different marketing channels impact sales and allows predictions for new advertising budgets.  

## Features  
- Load and preprocess the advertising dataset  
- Split dataset into training and testing sets  
- Train a **Linear Regression model**  
- Evaluate performance using:  
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
  - R-Squared Score (R²)  
- Compare **actual vs predicted sales**  
- Predict sales for a new advertising budget  

## Dataset  
- The dataset used: **advertising.csv**  
- Columns:  
  - **TV** → Advertising budget spent on TV  
  - **Radio** → Advertising budget spent on Radio  
  - **Newspaper** → Advertising budget spent on Newspaper  
  - **Sales** → Actual product sales (Target variable)  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn
